    <h1 id="text1">My Lime Orange Tree</h1>
	<p>Originally, I was going to do a YouTube channel that I enjoy, but there were too many, so I chose the theme as a book.</p>
	<p>This book is called 'My Lime Orange Tree'.</p>
	<h2 id="color1">Book report</h2>
	<p>This novel was published by the Brazilian novelist Jos√© Mauro de Vasconcelos (1920-1984).</p>
	<p>The protagonist, Jeze, a 5-year-old child living in Brazil, is the main character and draws various stories. Jeze, who lives in poverty with an unemployed father, a mother who works in a factory, three older sisters, an older brother, and a younger brother, suffers from bad things in her family. In fact, the treatment that Jeze receives in the film is child abuse. Jeze is also a villain, but the violence it inflicts is almost quasi-murderous. Jeze was mainly abused by his father, and whenever Zeze was abused, his older sister stopped his father, which, if I remember correctly, also caused violence to Jeze's older sister. He also had someone to depend on. Of course, there is his older sister, but there was a person called 'Portuga'. He is the only adult Jeze trusts and relies on. Portuga gave Jeze a good experience, giving him a car ride and getting around.</p>
	<p>I read this book when I was 10 or 11 years old. It's been about 11 years, but the reason I still remember it is because it was the first time I read a depressing book in my life. To be honest, I didn't read many books when I was young. I first came across this book because I had to read it for an assignment in elementary school. At first, of course, I thought it was about a dream or the future, so I started reading it without much interest, but I started to get shocked from the middle part. And it was difficult to read the book after seeing the details of Portuga's death described above. When I read the book, I was even young, and I was even more shocked because the contents of the book were so heavy. If my memory is correct, this book is not a happy ending. That's why I read this book once and haven't been able to read it again after that. It was shocking for some reason, but I didn't have much opportunity to concentrate on reading the book. To be honest, I loved watching movies at the time, so even when I went to the cinema with my father, I always watched two movies and headed home. Anyway, I read 'My Lime Orange Tree' because I didn't want it, but it's a good book that I can remember even after 10 years, and I still have it.</p>
